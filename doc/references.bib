abstract = {We present a magnetospheric model of the subauroral polarization stream (SAPS) electric potential, parameterized by Kp index (valid for Kp = 4–7), on the basis of a previous study of the average characteristics of SAPS. The model treats the SAPS westward flow channel as a potential drop whose radial location and width decrease as a function of both increasing magnetic local time (MLT) and increasing Kp. The magnitude of the SAPS potential drop decreases eastward across the nightside and increases with increasing Kp. The model SAPS flow channel significantly alters the flow paths of plasma in the afternoon and evening MLT sectors and agrees with an earlier single-event study that used an ad hoc SAPS potential to obtain good agreement with plasmasphere observations. The model performance is tested via comparison with 13 intervals of plasmapause data obtained during the period 1 April through 31 May 2001 by the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imager on the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite. Although the model performs well, the current Kp-based parameterization is somewhat crude, capturing only the gross spatial and temporal SAPS characteristics.},

abstract = {Regions of enhanced cold plasma, isolated from the main plasmasphere along the Explorer 45 (S³-A) orbit in the equatorial plane, have been detected by using the sheath-induced potentials seen by the electric field experiment. The occurrence of these regions has a strong correlation with negative enhancements of Dst, and their locations are primarily in the noon-dusk quadrant. The data support the concept that changes in large-scale convection play a dominant role in the formation of these regions. Plasma tails that are predicted from enhancements of large-scale convection electric fields in general define where these regions may be found. More localized processes are necessary to account for the exact configuration and structure seen in these regions and may eventually result in detachment from the main plasmasphere.},

By means of the Hamiltonian W of the motion, three regimes of motion are identified. A method is then developed for determining for any given observation point which arrival energies correspond to trapped particles and which represent ‘open’ trajectories.},

These electric fields drive ionospheric electric currents. Moreover, field-aligned electric currents must exist in order to maintain the magnetospheric electric field configuration. The model calculations are compared and are shown to be consistent with the shape of the plasmapause, the equivalent electric current systems of DP 1 and DP 2, the available electric field observations at ionospheric altitudes, and the observations of field-aligned electric currents.},

abstract = {Abstract Using measurements from the Van Allen Probes, a penetration event of tens to hundreds of keV electrons and tens of keV protons into the low L shells (L < 4) is studied. Timing and magnetic local time (MLT) differences of energetic particle deep penetration are unveiled and underlying physical processes are examined. During this event, both proton and electron penetrations are MLT asymmetric. The observed MLT difference of proton penetration is consistent with convection of plasma sheet protons, suggesting enhanced convection during geomagnetic active times to be the cause of energetic proton deep penetration during this event. The observed MLT difference of tens to hundreds of keV electron penetration is completely different from tens of keV protons and cannot be well explained by inward radial diffusion, convection of plasma sheet electrons, or transport of trapped electrons by enhanced convection electric field represented by the Volland-Stern model or a uniform dawn-dusk electric field model based on the electric field measurements. It suggests that the underlying physical mechanism responsible for energetic electron deep penetration, which is very important for fully understanding energetic electron dynamics in the low L shells, should be MLT localized.},
